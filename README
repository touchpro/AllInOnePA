___TEAM___LEGACY___

AllInOne is a new type of installer based off of BenjaminGwynn's work for .sense. His device support structure is all that I saved in doing this work. Expect multiple AIO releases, such as MIUI, ParanoidAndroid, and CM9 & CM10.

Eris, Hero and Heroc are too darn alike to let that trait go to waste, so why cook 3 separate roms for 3 separate phones?

Mucho credit to Benjamin Gwynn for the .sense base rom

whoshotjr2006, jordfaz, 1ceb0x, and tazzpatriot for unifying roms
